However, there is little known on how to use these architectural decisions, or what type of stakeholders need to use them. This paper presents a use case model that arose from industrial needs, and is meant to explore how these needs can be satisfied through the effective usage of architectural decisions by the relevant stakeholders. The use cases are currently being validated in practice through industrial case studies. As a result of this validation, we argue that the usage of architectural decisions by the corresponding stakeholders can enhance the quality of software architecture.},

	abstract = {Software engineering community has proposed several methods to evaluate software architectures with respect to desired quality attributes such as maintainability, performance, and so on. There is, however, little effort on systematically comparing such methods to discover similarities and differences between existing approaches. In this paper, we compare four well known scenario-based SA evaluation methods using an evaluation framework. The framework considers each method from the point of view of method context, stakeholders, structure, and reliability. The comparison reveals that most of the studied methods are structurally similar but there are a number of differences among their activities and techniques. Therefore, some methods overlap, which guides us to identify five common activities that can form a generic process model.},

	abstract = {While software architecture has become an increasingly important research topic in recent years, insufficient atten- tion has been paid to methods for evaluation of these archi- tectures. Evaluating architectures is difficult for two main reasons. First, there is no common language used to de- scribe different architectures. Second, there is no clear way of understanding an architecture with respect to an organi- zation's life cycle concerns—software quality concerns such as maintainability, portability, modularity, reusability, and so forth. This paper addresses these shortcomings by describing three perspectives by which we can understand the description of a software architecture and then propos- ing a five-step method for analyzing software architectures called SAAM (Software Architecture Analysis Method). We illustrate the method by analyzing three separate user in- terface architectures with respect to the quality of modifi- ability.},

abstract="Much of the research on automated Web Service Composition (WSC) relates it to an AI planning task, where the composition is primarily done offline prior to execution. Recent research on WSC has argued convincingly for the importance of optimizing quality of service, trust, and user preferences. While some of this optimization can be done offline, many interesting and useful optimizations are data-dependent, and must be done following execution of at least some information-gathering services. In this paper, we examine this class of WSC problems, attempting to balance the trade-off between offline composition and online information gathering with a view to producing high-quality compositions efficiently and without excessive data gathering. Our investigation is performed in the context of the semantic web employing an existing preference-based Hierarchical Task Network WSC system. Our experiments illustrate the potential improvement in both the quality and speed of composition generation afforded by our approach.",

        abstract = {The field of AI planning has seen rapid progress over the last decade and planners are now able to find plan with hundreds of actions in a matter of seconds. Despite those important progresses, robotic systems still tend to have a reactive architecture with very little deliberation on the course of the plan they might follow. In this thesis, we argue that a successful integration with a robotic system requires the planner to have capacities for both temporal and hierarchical reasoning. The former is indeed a universal resource central in many robot activities while the latter is a critical component for the integration of reasoning capabilities at different abstraction levels, typically starting with a high level view of an activity that is iteratively refined down to motion primitives. As a first step to carry out this vision, we present a model for temporal planning unifying the generative and hierarchical approaches. At the center of the model are temporal action templates, similar to those of PDDL complemented with a specification of the initial state as well as the expected evolution of the environment over time. In addition, our model allows for the specification of hierarchical knowledge possibly with a partial coverage. Consequently, our model generalizes the existing generative and HTN approaches together with an explicit time representation. In the second chapter, we introduce a planning procedure suitable for our planning model. In order to support hierarchical features, we extend the existing Partial-Order Causal Link approach used in many constraintbased planners, with the notions of task and decomposition. We implement it in FAPE (Flexible Acting and Planning Environment) together with automated problem analysis techniques used for search guidance. We show FAPE to have performance similar to state of the art temporal planners when used in a generative setting. The addition of hierarchical information leads to further performance gain and allows us to outperform traditional planners. In the third chapter, we study the usual methods used to reason on temporal uncertainty while planning. We relax the usual assumption of total observability and instead provide techniques to reason on the observations needed to maintain a plan dispatchable. We show how such needed observations can be detected at planning time and incrementally dealt with by considering the appropriate sensing actions. In a final chapter, we discuss the place of the proposed planning system as a central component for the control of a robotic actor. We demonstrate how the explicit time representation facilitates plan monitoring and action dispatching when dealing with contingent events that require observation. We take advantage of the constraint-based and hierarchical representation to facilitate both plan-repair procedures as well opportunistic plan refinement at acting time.}
